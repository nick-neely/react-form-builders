## Builders Showcase

### jQueryFormBuilder

**License**: OSS
**Description**: jQueryFormBuilder offers drag-and-drop functionality but struggled with React integration and lacked TypeScript typings, requiring many workarounds and custom types. The styling is subpar, making it less ideal for modern projects. There was very little documentation available for the React integration.

### Form.io

**License**: OSS
**Description**: Form.io is the best OSS option available, offering customization, custom components, validation, translation, and JSON schema for forms. It uses Bootstrap for styling, which is abstracted away and can clash with TailwindCSS, but while nontrivial, it allows adjustment of tabs and fields. Documentation is mediocre but could be improved.

### FormEngine

**License**: License Required
**Description**: FormEngine is very easy to implement with minimal code and has an intuitive interface. It supports custom components, validation, translation, JSON schema, adaptive layouts, JSON import/export, React hooks, state management, context, props, React DevTools, and custom CSS styling. Decent documentation on implementation.

### SurveyJS

**License**: License Required (per developer, for survey creator and up only)
**Description**: SurveyJS offers the most intuitive interface, is easy to implement, has excellent documentation, and is self-hosted. It supports JSON, localization, native React, reusable components, and a no-code CSS theme editor, providing a top-tier developer and UX experience. Fully integrated and self-hosted to your own app. In a high paid plan, ability to visit the dashboard to see all submission data in real time, processed on your own servers, with reports and a PDF generator.

### Joyfill

**License**: License Required
**Description**: Joyfill provides a user-friendly interface but requires using their services for JSON schema management, limiting control. Doesnâ€™t seem fitting.
